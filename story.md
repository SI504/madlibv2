# Welcome to Borromean University!

Where every ::1.txt:: student dreams of studying.

Today, we'll guide you through a typical day on campus.

Our day starts in the ::2.txt:: dormitory where students are woken up by a ::3.txt::
instead of an alarm clock. _It's a university tradition!_

Breakfast at the dining hall always consists of scrambled 
::4.txt:: and a glass of fresh ::5.txt:: juice.

After breakfast, it's time to head to your first class of the day: Advanced ::6.txt::
Taught by Professor Kelly, it's the most popular class at BU. 
Today's lecture? The history of ::7.txt:: .

Lunchtime is an event on its own. The special today? Grilled ::8.txt::
with a side of ::9.txt:: fries. Yum!

After classes, students love to hang out at the ::10.txt:: center, 
where you can join clubs like the Underwater ::11.txt:: Club or the ::12.txt::
Music Society.

Before you know it, it's time to head back to the dorm,
dream of your ::13.txt:: college adventures, and 
get ready for another day at Borromean University!
